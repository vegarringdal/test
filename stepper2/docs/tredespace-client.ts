// COPY THIS FILE into your host application (it is dependency-free and
// self-contained). It implements the protocol described in EVENTS.md of the
// viewer repository, protocol version 1. Keep the two in sync when updating.
//
// STRICT (enforced by the build): every command method needs a JSDoc comment
// AND a matching `### command` section with a fenced payload/response example in
// EVENTS.md — the /docs/ reference is generated from both. `vite build` fails if
// either is missing. See CLAUDE.md → "postMessage API".
//
// Commands NEVER throw — they resolve a Result<T> = { data?, error? }; check
// `error` (Rust-style). Only ready()/on*()/dispose() sit outside that.
//
// GETTING ACCESS (the viewer ignores messages from unknown origins):
//   The easiest bootstrap is the embed URL — your page controls it, and the
//   viewer honors ?apiOrigins= by default:
//     <iframe src="https://viewer.example.com/?apiOrigins=https://your-portal.example.com">
//   Alternatives: same-origin hosting needs nothing; or an admin lists your
//   origin under the viewer's Settings → External → API security (required if
//   a deployment turned the URL-parameter route off there).
//
// Usage — your page EMBEDS the viewer in an iframe:
//   const client = new TredespaceClient(iframe, { targetOrigin: 'https://viewer.example.com' });
//   await client.ready();                          // resolves on app.ready
//   const res = await client.selectionSet(['/TP400-PIPE-01']);
//   if (res.error) console.warn(res.error.msg);
//   else console.log(res.data.matched, res.data.missed);
//   client.dispose();
// Usage — your page runs INSIDE the viewer (External-app panel/dialog): same,
// but drive the parent window, with the VIEWER's origin as targetOrigin
// (derivable from document.referrer; never '*' — it is also the filter for
// which incoming messages this client trusts):
//   const viewerOrigin = new URL(document.referrer).origin;
//   const client = new TredespaceClient(window.parent, { targetOrigin: viewerOrigin });
//
// TALKING BETWEEN YOUR OWN FRAMES (browser storage partitioning):
//   When your page embeds the viewer and the viewer embeds a page of YOURS
//   back (an External-app panel or modal dialog), those two same-origin pages
//   of yours sit in DIFFERENT storage partitions: the nested one has a
//   cross-site ancestor (the viewer), so BroadcastChannel — and localStorage /
//   IndexedDB — do NOT reach between them. Measured, Chrome 151:
//     A → A                      (no viewer in between)     works
//     A → viewer(B) → A                                     nothing arrives
//     A → viewer(B) → A   (any iframe sandbox attribute)    nothing arrives
//     A | A side by side inside viewer(B)  (two dialogs)    works
//   It is not a sandbox or a permission the viewer controls — the one switch
//   that lifts it is Chrome's browser-wide
//   `--disable-features=ThirdPartyStoragePartitioning`, a global privacy
//   setting and never something to build a product on. Use instead:
//     - between two of YOUR pages inside the viewer: BroadcastChannel works
//       (same partition) — no relay needed.
//     - give the app `sandbox: ['storage-access']` and the nested page may ask
//       the browser for its unpartitioned cookies/storage itself
//       (document.requestStorageAccess(), a browser prompt) — test your SSO
//       flow on it; it is the browser's answer, not the viewer's.
//     - nested page ↔ your top page: postMessage directly (the nested page's
//       window.parent.parent is your top page; validate event.origin), or
//       relay through the viewer with instanceSet / onInstanceChanged — one
//       shared JSON blob per viewer window, broadcast to every embedded frame.
//     - serving the viewer from your own site (a path or a subdomain — a
//       subdomain is same-SITE) removes the cross-site ancestor entirely, and
//       all of the above just works.
//
// A TAB THE VIEWER OPENED (External app with newWindow): its window.opener
//   IS the viewer — drive it directly, like a panel drives window.parent:
//     const viewerOrigin = new URL(document.referrer).origin;
//     const client = new TredespaceClient(window.opener, { targetOrigin: viewerOrigin });
//     await client.ready();          // the viewer answers the client's hello
//   Events reach it too. It is a top-level page: first-party storage, no
//   partitioning. Reloading the viewer drops its handle on such tabs — reload
//   the tab to reconnect.
//
// WINDOWS YOU OPEN (relay):
//   A tab or popup opened by your host page — or by a page of YOURS inside
//   the viewer (give that app the 'popups' sandbox option) — holds no handle
//   on the viewer, and is storage-partitioned away from an embedded page
//   anyway. Let the opener RELAY: the new window
//   drives its opener with an unchanged client, the opener forwards to the
//   viewer.
//     // in the new window
//     const client = new TredespaceClient(window.opener, { targetOrigin: openerOrigin });
//     await client.ready();                       // answered by the relay
//     // in the opener (your top page, or a panel/dialog inside the viewer)
//     const win = window.open('https://your-portal.example.com/tool.html');
//     const off = client.relay(win, { origin: 'https://your-portal.example.com' });
//   Commands, responses, progress ticks, events and app.ready all pass
//   through. ArrayBuffer bytes are re-transferred (zero-copy); everything
//   else is structured-cloned once more per hop (~50 ms per 100k sqlExecute
//   rows — sqlSelect/sqlColor move no rows and cost nothing extra). A relayed
//   window's client can relay again to windows IT opens. The window gets
//   exactly the opener's API rights, so `origin` is mandatory and never '*'.
//   Lifecycle: onRelayChanged on the opener (connected / disconnected /
//   closed per window), onClosed on ANY client (its link ended: reason
//   'disposed' | 'relay' | 'target'); ending a relay closes the window's
//   client, and a closed window drops its relay by itself.
//
// HOSTING — proxy the viewer under your own site (recommended):
//   Framing tredespace.com directly makes the viewer a cross-site frame, so
//   the panels/dialogs of YOURS that open inside it are third-party: storage
//   partitioned, cookies/SSO not reaching them, BroadcastChannel silent. Put
//   the viewer behind your reverse proxy (a path or a subdomain) and embed
//   THAT — same-site, no ?apiOrigins= needed, your embedded panels keep their
//   session. nginx: `location /tredespace/ { proxy_pass https://tredespace.com/;
//   proxy_set_header Host tredespace.com; proxy_ssl_server_name on;
//   proxy_ssl_name tredespace.com; }` (full snippet in EVENTS.md → Hosting).
//   On an INTERNAL network this is not optional: tredespace.com is public, so
//   framed directly your internal panels would open inside a public-origin
//   frame (frame-ancestors refuses it, SSO cookies never arrive) and every
//   client needs internet access; proxied, the viewer is an internal URL and
//   only your server fetches tredespace.com.
//   In DEV the same bites: a host on http://localhost framing the public
//   viewer, which then opens your localhost panels = public → local request,
//   blocked by Chrome/Edge (Private Network Access). Proxy in dev too (Vite
//   server.proxy '/tredespace' → https://tredespace.com, changeOrigin) or, on
//   your own machine only, disable the "private network" block in
//   chrome://flags / edge://flags.
//   A proxy always serves the CURRENT release; to lock a version, host your
//   own container of a chosen build or fork the project.
//
// EVENTS (unsolicited app → host; subscribe with on() or the typed helpers).
//   Every subscription returns its UNSUBSCRIBE function, and also takes
//   { signal } like addEventListener. The subscription signal and the client's
//   own constructor { signal } are INDEPENDENT: a global, app-lifetime client
//   takes no signal (so no component can dispose it by accident), and each
//   component owns just its subscriptions with its own AbortController. Keep
//   the handler in a ref so a closure over changing state doesn't
//   re-subscribe every render:
//     export const client = new TredespaceClient(iframe, { targetOrigin }); // global
//     …
//     const latest = useRef(handler); latest.current = handler;
//     useEffect(() => {
//       const ac = new AbortController();
//       client.onTreeSelect((e) => latest.current(e), { signal: ac.signal });
//       client.onThemeChanged((e) => setTheme(e.theme), { signal: ac.signal });
//       return () => ac.abort();   // ends these subscriptions; the client lives on
//     }, []);
//   Pass { signal } to the CONSTRUCTOR only when the client should die with a
//   scope (a modal that embeds its own viewer): abort() then disposes it too.
//   dispose() drops the message listener wholesale — nothing fires after it.
//   'tree.select'                — user selected a tree row / clicked the model
//   'instance.changed'           — the shared instance-data blob changed
//   'viewpoints.bookmark'        — user clicked the host bookmark button
//                                  (onViewpointsBookmark; config attached)
//   'theme.changed'              — viewer theme switched, from any route
//                                  (onThemeChanged) — restyle your frames
//   'dialog.changed'             — an external dialog or panel opened / was
//                                  hidden / shown / renamed / is closing /
//                                  closed (onDialogChanged; onDialogClosing
//                                  gives YOUR page a last word before unmount)
//   'assets.importUrl:progress'  — per-file import progress (assetsImportUrl
//                                  surfaces it via its onProgress option)
//   'assets.load:progress'       — per-model load progress (assetsLoad /
//                                  assetsSetLoaded, same onProgress option)
//   'sql.importUrl:progress'     — per-file + per-chunk SQL import progress
//                                  (sqlImport / sqlImportUrl onProgress)
//   'sql.execute:progress'       — per-statement + per-N-rows batch progress
//                                  (sqlExecute onProgress)
//   'sql.color:progress'         — rows collected so far while a colouring
//   'sql.select:progress'          query runs (sqlColor / sqlSelect
//                                  onProgress)
//   LOCAL (raised by the client itself, never posted):
//   'client.closed'              — this client's link ended (onClosed;
//                                  reason 'disposed' | 'relay' | 'target')
//   'relay.changed'              — a window this client relays for connected /
//                                  disconnected / closed (onRelayChanged)
//
// COMMON FLOWS (each step is one method below — see its JSDoc):
//   Sync hosted models:   assetsList → compare each asset's md5 against a hash
//     of your hosted file → assetsImportUrl the changed/missing (replace:true),
//     assetsRemove the stale → assetsSetLoaded(desiredIds) applies the exact
//     visible set (idempotent; unlisted models are unloaded).
//   Colour from data:     sqlColor / sqlSelect run the query INSIDE the viewer
//     and hand the packed fullnames straight to the model DB — nothing but a
//     row count comes back, so million-row results are one message. For a list
//     your own backend produced, encodeNameList() + colorApplyList /
//     selectionSetList take the same packed path.
//   Sync hosted SQL dbs:  sqlList (md5 = hash of the bytes you delivered) →
//     sqlImportUrl only what changed (GB-safe: streamed straight into OPFS).
//     Or per query: sqlCheck(sql) pre-flights which dbs the script references
//     and whether they're present/current — then sqlQuery.
//   Viewpoint bookmarks:  viewpointsSetBookmarkButton({label}) → user clicks →
//     onViewpointsBookmark fires with the config blob → persist it; restore
//     later with viewpointsSet(config) or a hosted file via viewpointsSetUrl
//     (showViewer:true docks the presentation panel).
//   Context-dependent UI: externalAppsSet([...]) after ready() installs
//     SESSION-ONLY entries in the viewer's External ribbon (never persisted —
//     re-set them after every app.ready).
